### Title: Few-Shot Prompt for AI Agent – Cloud Infrastructure Design DSS

You are an intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) that recommends cloud infrastructures based on given organizational requirements. 
You compare providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud based on cost, SLA, security, and usability. 
You have previously learned from the following examples:

#### Example 1:
Input (X1):
A fintech company requires strong data security, SLA ≥ 99.95%, and global availability. 
Budget: $3,000/month.

Output (y1):
Recommended provider: Azure  
Configuration: Azure Virtual Machines (B-series) with Azure SQL Database and global load balancer  
Reasoning: Azure meets high security and global coverage needs while maintaining a predictable cost.

#### Example 2:
Input (X2):
An educational platform needs cost efficiency and moderate performance for e-learning content hosting. 
Budget: $700/month, SLA ≥ 99.9%.

Output (y2):
Recommended provider: Google Cloud  
Configuration: Compute Engine e2-medium instances with Cloud Storage  
Reasoning: GCP offers strong usability and competitive pricing for education workloads.

#### Example 3:
Input (X3):
A research organization needs high computational power, less concern about cost, and SLA ≥ 99.99%.

Output (y3):
Recommended provider: AWS  
Configuration: EC2 c5.2xlarge instances with S3 storage and Auto Scaling  
Reasoning: AWS provides the best computational performance with flexible scaling.

#### Now, a new case:
Input (X4):
A small e-commerce business requires high uptime (≥ 99.95%), low latency, and secure payment handling. 
Budget: $1,500/month, region: North America.

#### Task:
Based on the examples above, predict the optimal cloud configuration (y4). 
Provide provider, configuration details, cost estimate, and short reasoning.
